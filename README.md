# Machine Learning Specialization Labs

This repository contains all the Jupyter notebooks I worked on as part of the Machine Learning Specialization by Stanford University and DeepLearning.AI. These labs cover a broad range of fundamental and advanced machine learning topics, which I studied during the specialization.

## Overview

The notebooks in this repository include hands-on exercises that helped me solidify my understanding of key machine learning concepts. Below is a summary of the topics covered:

### Topics:
- **Linear Regression**: Implementing and understanding basic linear regression models for predicting continuous variables.
- **Regularization to Avoid Overfitting**: Techniques like Lasso and Ridge regression to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
- **Logistic Regression for Classification**: Implementing logistic regression for binary classification problems.
- **Gradient Descent**: Optimization techniques for minimizing cost functions, focusing on gradient descent.
- **Supervised Learning with TensorFlow**: Using TensorFlow for building machine learning models that learn from labeled data.
- **MLOps**: Exploring best practices for managing machine learning projects in production environments.
- **Artificial Neural Networks**: Building and training neural networks for various tasks using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **XGBoost**: Utilizing the powerful XGBoost algorithm for improving model accuracy in decision tree-based models.
- **Tree Ensembles & Anomaly Detection**: Working with ensemble methods like Random Forest and detecting anomalies in datasets.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Implementing clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques like K-Means and PCA.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Exploring how agents can learn optimal strategies through reward-based learning.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Techniques for building recommendation systems based on user-item interactions.
- **Recommender Systems**: Advanced models for recommending content using collaborative filtering and other strategies.

## Structure

Each notebook is dedicated to a specific concept or topic in machine learning. These notebooks not only implement various algorithms but also include theoretical explanations and visualizations to better understand each concept.

## Getting Started
